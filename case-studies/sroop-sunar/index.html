<dl>
<dt>What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?</dt>
<dd><p>I was a Graphic designer and Illustrator.</p>
</dd>
<dt>What made you want to start learning to code in the first place?</dt>
<dd><p>The desire to acquire new skills and learn new technologies made me want to start learning to code. I felt limited by my design skills and wanted to open up new doors for myself and expose myself to different opportunities. I also wanted to know how to make things for myself and explore a new creative medium. Coding ticked all the boxes!</p>
</dd>
<dt>How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply to the programming course?</dt>
<dd><p>I googled around for courses - Makers was up there as the best. I read countless student reviews and was really impressed by the unique classroom teaching style. I was also won over by the placements team who seemed to be putting graduates into insanely good starting positions at some awesome companies.</p>
</dd>
<dt>What did you find difficult during the course?</dt>
<dd><p>To begin with, I found pairing with other people quite hard and frustrating but then halfway through the course, you learn how to do it well and it's the best experience. I also found the fast pace quite difficult to keep up with. It didn't bother me so much though, and I trusted that given the extra hard work I put it, it would all eventually make sense.</p>
</dd>
<dt>What happened during/after graduation and where are you job-wise?</dt>
<dd><p>After graduation I hit the ground running with back-to-back interviews and technical tests. The placements team are incredible and so supportive. I landed a job 4 weeks later.</p>
</dd>
<dt>How has your life changed since graduation?</dt>
<dd><p>It's turned my life around. I didn't take this course with the intention of becoming a developer. At the time, I was interested in acquiring some front end skills so I could push forward my design work and take things from there. I ended up loving Ruby and getting a full stack role at a brilliant agency. I have a job that I love with clear focus, direction and endless possibilities.</p>
</dd>
<dt>What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?</dt>
<dd><p>Do it. The direction of your life is never set in stone. Make sensible decisions, follow your heart and enjoy the ride.</p>
</dd>
<dt>What would you say to people who say £8,000 is very expensive?</dt>
<dd><p>I thought the exact same thing. I was umm-ing and ahh-ing about whether to apply for ages because of the huge price tag. But after the first day, you completely forget that this was ever an issue. Worth every penny.</p>
</dd>
<dt>What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?</dt>
<dd><p>My biggest worry was whether or not I would actually be able to learn anything of any value. Will I understand the content? Will I actually be able to sit down and make something from scratch? Would I become more employable? Will I get a job? Nothing is guaranteed on the course, but I can say that with enough enthusiasm, positivity and hard work there is no reason to worry.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Sum up your Makers Academy experience</dt>
<dd><p>Emotional, exhausting, exhilarating.</p>
</dd>
<dt>What advice would you give to people interviewing for developer roles?</dt>
<dd><p>Be yourself. Students from Makers Academy are not the same kind of species as normal developers out there and it's your background and experiences which don't necessarily relate to coding that will give you an edge. And TDD everything.</p>
