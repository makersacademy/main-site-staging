<dl>
<dt>What were you doing before joining Makers Academy?</dt>
<dd><p>I had just finished my Graphic Design and Communication Degree, doing GIFS at Central Saint Martins in July 2017. When I got a place at Makers immediately after my degree, from then until October, I spent time in Boston to help my family send my brother to university and back home to Malaysia. I may have traveled a bit here and there as well.</p>
</dd>
<dt>How did you come across Makers Academy and what made you decide to apply?</dt>
<dd><p>A friend of mine whom I went to boarding school in Australia did the course during one of her summers. She was doing her business, political economics, and computer science degree at NYU and still is, I believe. How I bumped into her though was that every year her course would be somewhere different and her second year happened to be in London. She's very intelligent, very into entrepreneurship and she recommended me to do the course as it was life-changing.</p>

<p>Although I greatly trust her recommendations, I picked this course not fully understanding what I was getting myself into (as everyone does). However, after graduation, I was in a state where I felt I was nowhere near ready for the working world given I was the project manager for last year's Central Saint Martin's Graphic Design &amp; Communication Degree Show. Managing 160 people on top of your own work doesn't give energy, time or room to brand or connect yourself with those in the Design industry.</p>

<p>Plus, I always had an interest in coding and knew one day when given the chance, I would pursue it. Central Saint Martins had introduced it to us but I knew there was more to coding than moving a ball on the screen. Although I thought it was the perfect route for me to follow because it delayed my time to figure things out, it was more because I saw the benefits of coding expanding my creative career as a designer or animator in terms of sustainability and as a potential gap filler in the design and development market today.</p>
</dd>
<dt>What did you find difficult during the course?</dt>
<dd><p>Coming straight from an intense university, where I worked day and night, the workload and that schedule was not difficult at all. Many claim that's the common struggle but I guess when you shift from the working world where you program your brain to turn off at 6 pm, that can be an obstacle to overcome.</p>

<p>This is going to sound strange but the hardest hurdles are allowing the changes that will happen to you over the course, whether it'd be in code, in yourself or the life around you. It's not easy to change the way you think, the way you see things, to focus on the progress of the present day rather thinking ahead and to realize that you didn't know yourself as well as you thought. It takes time and daily effort. What makes it harder is also when you are the only one who can decide and execute how you are either going to adapt to manage these changes.</p>

<p>No matter how many are around you or are in the same boat, you are on your own learning journey at Makers. There is no one forcing you to be the best, to put immense pressure on yourself or have the best record, so really it's daunting that there's no scapegoat to blame but yourself. However, having that individual spotlight on you all the time could shine at certain truths that you find it hard to believe or that you do not want to face. That can be beautiful to experience but also emotionally challenging for you to allow the experience to happen.</p>

<p>This is probably the reason why Makers is life-changing but anything that is life-changing is nowhere near easy and worth it.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Where are you working now?</dt>
<dd><p>Currently, I am still job-hunting for a front-end developer role. It's the perfect mix to get your hands on design and tech.</p>

<p>However, the development community is so supportive and a lot of companies are willing to make the effort to talk and get to know you. What I really like about this industry it's a two-way relationship where companies are wanting to care for well-trained developers (such as Makers one) and where we are wanting to work hard and be constantly learning. Tech is such an exciting world given it is always evolving and so there is such a demand for developers who have these traits.</p>

<p>In other words, the world is a developer's oyster right now.</p>
</dd>
<dt>How has your life changed since graduation?</dt>
<dd><p>I always laugh at this question and tell people that in short, I've matured more in 3 months than in 4 years at university.</p>

<p>However, to give more of an insight, my life has changed dramatically. I thought learning how to draw a circle on CSS and HTML was hard and now I'm doing crazy things like building chat-bots, scrappers, building apps from scratch and learning a language in two days. I also have learned more about myself, about how I learn as a designer, methods about how to adapt to change and how to constantly be growing and current in my work and in areas of my life. I appreciate and live more in the present. I appreciate where people come from and are more patient with those I come across. I'm unafraid of diving into the deep end to drown and then swim my way back to get on my two feet.</p>

<p>A lot of changes occurred as you can see but the best change I think I overcame is the fact that I'm unafraid to chase my dreams and go through the struggles. No matter how bad the situation is, the experience at Makers teaches you that things will always work out somehow.</p>
</dd>
<dt>What advice would you give to people thinking of changing career?</dt>
<dd><p>I can't really give solid advice given I'm a double graduate and haven't entered the working world yet. However, I've always been a believer in doing what you love and chasing your passions. So, I think to change your career for something to love is something everyone should strive for.</p>

<p>Sure, you may not be doing something you love now and perhaps you may not be living your passions now. However, if whatever it may be is really your passion, you'll work your way around the obstacles to find the time and make it. A lot of the time we think achieving our passion is to be no.1 or the best in the world but your passion isn't to be no.1 (unless it is, which hey that's fine). Sometimes achieving our passions is just to do it every day and be good at it. You are never too old and never too late to start, especially if your passion is in tech.</p>

<p>Just FYI, you all are probably like Boo hypocrite! You changed your career from design to tech but Design and Tech both are dependent on each other. They are both evolving tool industries of the same creative universe, responsible for connecting clients with their customers with their skill-sets. It's a designer's role today to know how to code and developers are already building UX mock-ups.</p>

<p>So I wouldn't say I changed my career path. I would simply say I evolved it.</p>
</dd>
<dt>What do you say to people who say £8000 is expensive?</dt>
<dd><p>It is, haha! Though, I will commend that the resources and the team Makers provide for you are 60% of the value. They provide great teaching and support in terms of you becoming a developer.</p>

<p>However, I really think you would get your full money's worth by going onsite and I say that because of the experience you'll have with your cohort. I can't speak for all, but I learn best through experience and I learned even faster when I got to have that communication, that interaction, with the community. To physically be there and indulge all the lessons you'll learn from people is more impactful for your learning.</p>
</dd>
<dt>What was your biggest worry before joining Makers Academy and how do you feel about it now?</dt>
<dd><p>There is never just one fear for a Maker, so I'll list the top fears. As a graduate, I felt really nervous coming into Makers with a different demographic. It made it even worse when I knew amongst my whole cohort, I got to pair with the intellectual bunch. However, having gone through the experience, everyone is on the same level. No matter what age or how much experience they've had with code, everyone at Makers has always something to learn and honestly, it's really funny to see how adults struggle with technology that isn't to do with code. Things like recording videos and Airplay, the classics.</p>

<p>Another fear of mine was also facing my biggest nemesis, which was learning logic as I didn't do so well in Math. However, you'd be surprised how coding is actually a creative process and the value of having that background. Things such as having an explorative or experimental mindset, drawing diagrams, collaborating in teams are behaviours that are not easy to have unless you've trained your whole life to acquire them. I never realised how valuable those skills are until I did my final project.</p>

<p>So I've learned a lot about erasing assumptions and never to underestimate yourself whilst overcoming these fears."</p>
</dd>
<dt>Sum up your Makers Academy experience</dt>
<dd><p>I'll try not use the cliche words but if I had to really sum up my experience, it was refreshing and a good deep cleansing of the mind.</p>

<p>Sure, it may have been emotionally intense and challenging but it's like one of those hard massages or yoga that put all your bones back in place. I've come out feeling so much more balanced. I never realised my mind had so many tangles that needed to be untied until the Joy Officer there shined some lights on me. I feel so much more sure of myself but also feel more prepared for the next steps as I have the tools to keep growing in my passions of design&amp;tech and my life. I know I'm not mentioning anything about code hah, so I'll get to that now!</p>

<p>It was a really personalised and explorative experience when it came to learning code at Makers, and that's really how one should be learning code. To keep being curious to explore and to focus on their own personal learning of whether they were a better developer than they were yesterday. It's a world that may seem daunting but nothing is really if you give the time and effort to pick at the archeological dig every-day. Makers provided that incredible experience for me for 12 weeks, and I've come out constantly wanting to dig into tech and find it's potential fit with the world of design.</p>
