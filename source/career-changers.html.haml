      %h3 Why switch to a career as a developer?
    %p
      Not satisfied with your job? Want to go to work and love what you do, day in day out? It’s time for a career change, and coding could be exactly what you’re looking for.
    %p
      At Makers Academy, we’ve helped everybody from stay-at-home parents and recruiters to scientists and lawyers make their first step towards a career they’re passionate about, in jobs with huge growth opportunities.
    %p
      The technology sector has been growing rapidly for years, and has been largely unaffected by the recession. With demand for developers growing 20% year-on- year, and supply of developers (mainly graduates of computer science degrees) flat lining at 1%, the demand for developers is growing rapidly. In short - the tech industry needs you!
    %p
      Be in full control of your career and have creative freedom. Technology companies are notoriously known to have fun, playful offices and a relaxed, friendly working culture. On top of that, working in web development brings a wealth of opportunities to grow, learn and enjoy your work again. What are you waiting for?
