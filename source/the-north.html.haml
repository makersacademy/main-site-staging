      %h3 Why switch to a career as a developer?
    %p
      Not satisfied with your job? Want to go to work and love what you do, day in day out? It’s time for a career change, and coding could be exactly what you’re looking for.
    %p
      At Makers Academy, we’ve helped everybody from stay-at-home parents and recruiters to scientists and lawyers make their first step towards a career they’re passionate about, in jobs with huge growth opportunities.
    %p
      The technology sector has been growing rapidly for years, and has been largely unaffected by the recession. With demand for developers growing 20% year-on-year, and supply of developers (mainly graduates of Computer Science degrees), flat lining at 1%, the demand for developers is growing rapidly.
    %p
      According to Tech Nation, Manchester is the largest tech cluster outside London – with nearly 52,000 employees in the sector. There are
      =link_to "10 tech jobs for every 100 residents,", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-37380696", target: "_blank"
      which is pretty awesome when you compare London that has only four jobs for every 100. In short there’s a bigger skills gap in the north so it’s the perfect time to learn to code and start your career as a developer. The tech industry in the north needs you!
